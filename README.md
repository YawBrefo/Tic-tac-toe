# Tic-tac-toe
This is a fun project to play the game tic tac toe. 
It is a naive python implementation of the game. 
While the original board game is 3-dimensional, this code is designed to take higher dimensional inputs.
Enjoy, and please give feedback though my mail (bdwamena@aimsammi.org), thanks!!
